# DWI Workshop Day 4 - Connectome Construction and Graph Theory Analysis 

## Overview 

In this section we will review consideraitons for connectome construction, post-processing and visualization along with graph theory analysis, limitations and interpretation.

## Connectome Construction: 

After generating a tractogram, connectivity analysis and graph theory are popular methods of analyzing and distilling structural connectivity information, which can be modeled as a 2D matrix of nodes and edges. 

## Graph Theory: 

Graph theory is a mathematical construct to distill the information about a connectome into its properties. It is a convenient tool that makes group comparisons and stastical reporting easy, but several limitations and caveats remain in terms of interpretation. Moreover, many graph theory metrics are senstive to how the graph is generative as well as connectome post-processing.
